This folder consolidates analysis reports, checklists, and migration notes that were previously scattered in the repository root.

Contents you will typically find here:
- Compile and migration reports (e.g., COMPILE_FIX_*.md, VERSION_CATALOG_FIX_REPORT.md)
- Issue analyses and fix summaries (e.g., CREDIT_CARD_*, DATA_STORAGE_ANALYSIS.md)
- Temporary planning and checklists (e.g., FINAL_CHECKLIST.md, CONTINUE_HERE.md)
- Text lists generated during debugging (e.g., files_to_fix.txt, missing_types.txt)

Rationale: keep project root focused on build and modules while documentation lives under doc/.
