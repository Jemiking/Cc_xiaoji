MCP Configuration Update Instructions
=====================================

The MCP has been migrated from WSL to Windows native.

To update your configuration:

1. Open a NEW Command Prompt or PowerShell window (NOT inside Claude Code)

2. Run ONE of these commands:
   
   Command Prompt:
   cd D:\kotlin\Cc_xiaoji
   update-mcp-en.bat
   
   OR PowerShell:
   cd D:\kotlin\Cc_xiaoji
   .\update-mcp-en.bat

3. After the script completes:
   - Type "exit" in Claude Code to quit
   - Start Claude Code again with "claude"
   - The MCP should now run on Windows

To verify the configuration is working:
- Run: diagnose-mcp-en.bat

Files created:
- android-compiler-mcp-windows/     (Windows MCP server)
- update-mcp-en.bat                 (Update script)
- diagnose-mcp-en.bat               (Diagnostic script)

The Windows MCP server is already tested and working.
